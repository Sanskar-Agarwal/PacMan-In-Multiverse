<h1> PacMan-In-Multiverse</h1>

<p>In this project, I have refactored existing codebase given by Arcade 24â„¢ (A24). Who had made a simple version of PacMan Game with White Pills and Ghosts to and extension: <b>PacMan-In-Multiverse</b></p>

<h2> Extensions </h2>

- Refactoring the existing code to meet software engineering design principles. A well-designed model will make the design and implementation of the proposed extensions
much simpler. I have used GoF and GRASP Design Principles, a report has been added highlighting key design decisions taken and their justification.
-Addition of new monsters and items as per specifications
